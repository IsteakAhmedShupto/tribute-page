          Biography of Ada Lovelace: The first computer programmer
        </h1>
        <p class="main-section-caption">
          Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. Even though
          she wrote about a computer, the Analytical Engine, that was never
          built, she realized that the computer could follow a series of simple
          instructions, a program, to perform a complex calculation.

                Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English
                mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
                Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the
                Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the
                machine had applications beyond pure calculation.
              </p>

                />
              </div>
              <p>
                When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a
                long working relationship and friendship with fellow British
                mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of
                computers".
              </p>
              <p>
                She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the
                Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through
                their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.

              <p>
                From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities
                began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the
                majority of her adult life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of
                which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was
                taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated
                in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, and
                Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and
                scientific author.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill
                in mathematics might lead her to become "an original
                mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence".

                The Cardano cryptocurrency platform, launched in 2017, uses Ada
                as the name for the cryptocurrency and Lovelace as the smallest
                sub-unit of an Ada.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2021, Lovelace was directly honoured in the codename of
                Nvidia's new GPU architecture featured in its RTX 4000 series.
                Ada Lovelace is the first Nvidia architecture to feature both a
                first and last name.

                Six copies of the 1843 first edition of Sketch of the Analytical
                Engine with Ada Lovelace's "Notes" have been located. Three are
                held at Harvard University, one at the University of Oklahoma,
                and one at the United States Air Force Academy.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 20 July 2018, the sixth copy was sold at auction to an
                anonymous buyer for Â£95,000. A digital facsimile of one of the
                copies in the Harvard University Library is available online.
              </p>
              <p>
                In December 2016, a letter written by Ada Lovelace was forfeited
                by Martin Shkreli to the New York State Department of Taxation
                and Finance for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli.
